# Ollama-Based-Intelligent-Data-Exploration

Easy AI Data Analyst
This project is a local AI tool that acts like a personal data scientist. You simply upload a CSV file (like an Excel sheet), and the tool automatically cleans the data, creates charts, and uses an AI model (Gemma 2) to explain what the data means.

 What does it do?
Cleans Data Automatically: If your file has missing information, the tool intelligently fills it in so the analysis doesn't break.

Generates Statistics: It gives you a quick summary of your data (averages, totals, and counts).

Creates Visuals: It automatically draws histograms and a "heat map" to show how different parts of your data relate to each other.

AI Business Insights: It uses a local AI engine (Ollama) to read your data and write 3-5 bullet points explaining the most important "takeaways" for a business.

100% Private: Because it uses Ollama, your data never leaves your computer. No internet or cloud services are required for the AI to work.
